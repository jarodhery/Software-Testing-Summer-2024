<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, Welcome to Truck Delivery Project - Group 8 🚚</h1>
<h3 align="center">A group project worked on by five fellow Seneca students.</h3>

🔭  We are developing a solution for a local delivery company to manage multiple trucks and routes for package delivery. <br> <br>
🎯  Our objective is to design and build a system that efficiently assigns packages to trucks based on factors such as weight, size, and proximity to the destination.

<h3 align="left">⌨️Description:</h3>
The city is represented by a 25 by 25 square grid where various elements such as buildings, routes, and delivery paths are mapped out. The objective is to optimize the assignment of delivery trucks to packages based on the distance to the destination and the truck's available capacity. This also involves managing package diversions and calculating the most efficient delivery paths.
